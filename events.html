                A number of dogs have gone into space under the former Soviet
                Union. The most well-known was Laika in 1957. She was picked up
                off the streets as a stray mongrel puppy in Moscow and deemed
                suitable because of her gentle temperament. The scientists also
                believed a stray would be better at coping with adverse
                conditions. Though other dogs had been launched into space
                before her, Laika is famous for being the first animal to orbit
                the Earth. However, she was never to return. She was sent off
                with just one meal and a seven-day oxygen supply. Overheated,
                cramped, frightened, and probably hungry, the space dog gave her
                life for her country, involuntarily fulfilling a canine suicide
                mission. The Soviet government claimed she survived for seven
                days. The reality: Laika overheated and died just five hours
                into the flight.

                For about 21 hours while in orbit he heard a noise coming from
                the outside, an irregular pulse against his door, just as if
                someone was knocking: Knock knock - who's there? "It didn't come
                from outside or from inside the spaceship, but it seemed that
                someone was knocking on the lining of the spaceship as you could
                beat an iron bucket with a wooden hammer". He tried to see
                something out of the ordinary, but found nothing, the man
                immediately communicated the thing to the base, from which the
                answers did not arrive ... No one was in fact ready for such an
                eventuality, so much so that they could not even find a rational
                explanation incident. Once back on Earth, the astronaut together
                with his team, analyzed the possible causes, but nothing was
                able to explain the anomaly, so that after almost 20 years it
                continues to be one of the strangest cases reported by space
                missions.

                This far-off blue planet may look like a friendly haven, but
                don't be deceived! Weather here is deadly. The planet's cobalt
                blue color comes from a hazy, blow-torched atmosphere containing
                clouds laced with glass. Howling winds send the storming glass
                sideways at 5,400 mph (2km/s), whipping all in a sickening
                spiral. It's death by a million cuts on this slasher planet! HD
                189733 b is a gas giant exoplanet that orbits a K-type star. Its
                mass is 1.13 Jupiters, it takes 2.2 days to complete one orbit
                of its star, and is 0.0313 AU from its star. Its discovery was
                announced in 2005. If seen directly, this planet would look like
                a deep blue dot, reminiscent of Earth's color as seen from
                space. That is where the comparison ends. On this turbulent
                alien world, the daytime temperature is nearly 2,000 degrees
                Fahrenheit, and it possibly rains glass — sideways — in howling,
                4,500-mph winds. The cobalt blue color comes not from the
                reflection of a tropical ocean as it does on Earth, but rather a
                hazy, blow-torched atmosphere containing high clouds laced with
                silicate particles. Silicates condensing in the heat could form
                very small drops of glass that scatter blue light more than red
                light.

                <h3>KELT-9b</h3>

                The heat of KELT-9b is too much even for molecules to remain
                intact. Molecules of hydrogen gas are likely ripped apart on the
                dayside of tidally-locked KELT-9b, unable to re-form until their
                disjointed atoms flow around to the planet's nightside. With a
                dayside temperature of more than 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit (4,600
                Kelvin), KELT-9b is a planet that is hotter than most stars. But
                its star, called KELT-9, is even hotter; a blue A-type star that
                is likely unraveling the planet through evaporation. KELT-9b is
                a gas giant 2.8 times more massive than Jupiter, but only half
                as dense. Scientists would expect the planet to have a smaller
                radius, but the extreme radiation from its host star has caused
                the planet's atmosphere to puff up like a balloon. The planet is
                also unusual in that it orbits perpendicular to the spin axis of
                the star. That would be analogous to the planet orbiting
                perpendicular to the plane of our solar system. One "year" on
                this planet is less than two days long. With each orbit, KELT-9
                b twice experiences the full range of stellar temperatures,
                producing what amounts to a peculiar seasonal sequence. The
                planet experiences “summer” when it swings over each hot pole
                and “winter” when it passes over the star's cooler midsection.
                So KELT-9 b experiences two summers and two winters every orbit,
                with each season about nine hours.
