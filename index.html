                The doomed planet WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter that orbits so close
                to its parent star, it's being torn apart. It takes this alien
                world only 1.1 days to completely circle its sun. The star's
                scorching heat is slowly stripping away and devouring the
                planet's atmosphere. In 10 million years, this alien world could
                be completely consumed. Almost two times the size of our
                Jupiter, WASP-12b is a sizzling gas giant whose temperature is
                approximately 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,210 degrees Celsius).
                Gravity causes enormous tidal forces which are streching the
                planet into the shape of an egg. A hulking monster of a star is
                stealing pieces of its nearby planet, WASP-12b, to assemble
                itself into the ultimate Frankenstein creation. The extreme
                gravity is stretching the hot gas giant into the shape of an
                egg, all the while slowly cannibalizing the planet. Relatively
                soon (10 million years; a fleeting moment in space time) this
                planet will be completely devoured by its hungry star. If you
                enjoy watching the world fall to pieces, then this planet is for
                you.

                Kepler-36b and its companion planet, Kepler-36c, are far too
                close to their sun to be in the habitable zone, but they are
                bizarrely close to each other. On their closest approach, they
                come within about 1.2 million miles (1.9 million kilometers) of
                each other. Despite being in a similar orbital distance from
                their star, the pair are very different. Kepler-36b, is a
                super-Earth that orbits a G-type star 1,533 light-years from
                Earth in 13.9 days. Its mass is about four times greater than
                Earth's. Its companion planet, Kepler-36c is Neptune-sized with
                a mass more than seven times Earth's; it takes 16.2 days to
                complete one orbit of the star, which is older and hotter than
                our Sun. The two planets have repeated close encounters,
                experiencing a conjunction every 97 days on average. At that
                time, they are separated by less than five Earth-moon distances.
                Such close approaches stir up tremendous gravitational tides
                that squeeze and stretch both planets, which may promote active
                volcanism on Kepler-36b.

                This far-off blue planet may look like a friendly haven, but
                don't be deceived! Weather here is deadly. The planet's cobalt
                blue color comes from a hazy, blow-torched atmosphere containing
                clouds laced with glass. Howling winds send the storming glass
                sideways at 5,400 mph (2km/s), whipping all in a sickening
                spiral. It's death by a million cuts on this slasher planet! HD
                189733 b is a gas giant exoplanet that orbits a K-type star. Its
                mass is 1.13 Jupiters, it takes 2.2 days to complete one orbit
                of its star, and is 0.0313 AU from its star. Its discovery was
                announced in 2005. If seen directly, this planet would look like
                a deep blue dot, reminiscent of Earth's color as seen from
                space. That is where the comparison ends. On this turbulent
                alien world, the daytime temperature is nearly 2,000 degrees
                Fahrenheit, and it possibly rains glass — sideways — in howling,
                4,500-mph winds. The cobalt blue color comes not from the
                reflection of a tropical ocean as it does on Earth, but rather a
                hazy, blow-torched atmosphere containing high clouds laced with
                silicate particles. Silicates condensing in the heat could form
                very small drops of glass that scatter blue light more than red
                light.

                <h3>KELT-9b</h3>
              </div>

                The heat of KELT-9b is too much even for molecules to remain
                intact. Molecules of hydrogen gas are likely ripped apart on the
                dayside of tidally-locked KELT-9b, unable to re-form until their
                disjointed atoms flow around to the planet's nightside. With a
                dayside temperature of more than 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit (4,600
                Kelvin), KELT-9b is a planet that is hotter than most stars. But
                its star, called KELT-9, is even hotter; a blue A-type star that
                is likely unraveling the planet through evaporation. KELT-9b is
                a gas giant 2.8 times more massive than Jupiter, but only half
                as dense. Scientists would expect the planet to have a smaller
                radius, but the extreme radiation from its host star has caused
                the planet's atmosphere to puff up like a balloon. The planet is
                also unusual in that it orbits perpendicular to the spin axis of
                the star. That would be analogous to the planet orbiting
                perpendicular to the plane of our solar system. One "year" on
                this planet is less than two days long. With each orbit, KELT-9
                b twice experiences the full range of stellar temperatures,
                producing what amounts to a peculiar seasonal sequence. The
                planet experiences “summer” when it swings over each hot pole
                and “winter” when it passes over the star's cooler midsection.
                So KELT-9 b experiences two summers and two winters every orbit,
                with each season about nine hours.
