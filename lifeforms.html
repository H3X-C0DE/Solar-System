                  The Fermi Paradox refers to the dichotomy between the high
                  probability that extraterrestrial intelligence exists and the
                  fact that we have no evidence for such aliens. This paradox
                  was described by the late British science-fiction author, Sir
                  Arthur C. Clarke, who said: "Two possibilities exist: Either
                  we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally
                  terrifying." Many experts since have grappled with the same
                  question. Why, considering the multitude of planets and stars
                  in the Milky Way, have we not heard from anyone?We call this
                  problem the Fermi Paradox, and there are a number of possible
                  solutions — some more unnerving than others. The Fermi Paradox
                  is a problem that asks, where are all the aliens(opens in new
                  tab) in the universe? If life is so abundant, why haven't we
                  been visited by, or heard from, anyone else? According to
                  NASA(opens in new tab), in just the last two decades we have
                  found more than 4,000 planets beyond our solar system, with
                  trillions of stars thought to exist in our galaxy — most of
                  which host their own planets. Considering life sprang up on
                  Earth, would we not have expected it to start in at least one
                  other location in the last 14 billion years of the universe?

                  The Drake equation is an idea, proposed by the American
                  astronomer Frank Drake in 1961, that the number of potential
                  civilizations in the universe can be calculated if we know a
                  few key variables. The formula for the Drake equation is: N =
                  R* x 𝑓p x ne x 𝑓1 x 𝑓i x 𝑓c x L R* = average rate of star
                  formation in Milky Way 𝑓p = fraction of stars supporting
                  planets ne = average number of planets that could potentially
                  support life for each star that hosts planets 𝑓1 = fraction of
                  those planets that "could" support life that actually develop
                  life 𝑓i = fraction of planets that develop intelligent life,
                  and thus intelligent civilizations 𝑓c = fraction of those
                  civilizations that develop a technology to communicate their
                  existence L = length of time over which these civilizations
                  send those detectable signals into space By including all of
                  these factors in the equation, the idea is you might be able
                  to work out how many other intelligent civilizations exist in
                  the universe. This "simple" formula, Drake once said, would be
                  akin to estimating the number of students at a university by
                  multiplying the number of new students entering each year by
                  the average number of years a student will spend at a
                  university, according to SETI(opens in new tab). As of yet,
                  however, a number of key variables in the equation remain
                  unknown, meaning we can't yet come up with a possible number
                  for other species of intelligent life.

                  Simply stated, the Great Filter says that intelligent
                  interstellar lifeforms must first take many critical steps,
                  and at least one of these steps must be highly improbable.
                  Indeed, the premise of the Great Filter is that there's at
                  least one hurdle that is so high virtually no species can
                  clear it and move on to the next. But while the term the Great
                  Filter suggests the conscious action of some sort of exogenous
                  entity, in reality, the hypothesis is more a way of thinking
                  about the relative likelihood of certain events happening — or
                  not happening — in their own natural course. So, what basic
                  hurdles must be cleared in order to become a truly advanced,
                  spacefaring civilization? Hanson suggested a few, paraphrased
                  below: A planet capable of harboring life must form in a
                  star's habitable zone. Life itself must develop on that
                  planet. Those lifeforms must be able to reproduce, using such
                  molecules as DNA and RNA. Simple cells (prokaryotes) must
                  evolve into more complex cells (eukaryotes). Multicellular
                  organisms must develop. Sexual reproduction, which greatly
                  increases genetic diversity, must take hold. Complex organisms
                  capable of using tools must evolve. Those organisms must
                  create advanced technology needed for space colonization.
                  (This is roughly where humans are today.) The spacefaring
                  species must go on to colonize other worlds and star systems,
                  while avoiding destroying itself. While humans are not yet
                  capable of interstellar travel in any meaningful sense (beyond
                  a few small robotic probes like the Pioneer, Voyager, and New
                  Horizons spacecraft), we are capable of advanced radio
                  astronomy, meaning we're a relatively tech-savvy civilization.
                  But even if it took the same inordinate amount of time for an
                  alien civilization to make the technological leaps humanity
                  has, given the age of the universe, there should be at least a
                  few interplanetary species colonizing their entire galaxy by
                  now.

                  In 1964, Kardashev came up with the idea that the status of a
                  culture, as a whole, depends on two primary things: Energy and
                  technology. He theorized that a civilization's technical
                  advancement runs parallel to the amount of energy that the
                  civilization is able to harness and manipulate. Essentially,
                  the more energy that a society can produce, the more
                  technologically advanced they are (this was originally just
                  tied to energy available for communications, but has since
                  been expanded). In other words, according to this theory, a
                  culture's development (in the very widest sense) is a product
                  of energy and of technology: Through technology, energy is
                  harnessed, and as social systems are expressions of this
                  technology, the status of a culture rests upon (and is
                  determined by) the amount of energy that is harnessed. The
                  scale has a number of different categories (levels of
                  classification). In recent years, scientists have expanded
                  this scale to measure hypothetical civilizations—civilizations
                  that are galactic, intergalactic, and even multiverse in
                  nature.
