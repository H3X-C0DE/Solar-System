                The sun is burning all the time. However, there are times when
                the Sun might get a bit bright. And this sudden burst of
                brightness is known as "Solar Flare". But most of the time a
                solar flare will be accompanied by another phenomenon known as
                "Coronal Mass Ejection". They can go in any direction. Matter of
                fact, there are times when the particles and radio-waves from
                the solar flare might come towards the Earth as well. In those
                cases, we will face various issues on Earth. Interestingly, such
                a strong solar storm almost hit the Earth on 23rd July 2012.
                This was a potentially damaging solar flare. Lucky for us, we
                have barely escaped from it.

                You might be sitting still somewhere reading this post. But at
                the same time, our planet Earth is revolving around the sun at a
                speed of about 67 thousand miles per hour or 107 thousand
                kilometers per hour. Similarly, the sun is also moving around
                the center of the Milky Way galaxy at a speed of about 828
                thousand kilometers per hour or 230 km per second. Whereas our
                galaxy "Milky Way" is moving through space at a speed of about
                1.4 million miles per hour 2.2 million kilometers per hour. That
                is unbelievably fast!

                When a star dies, it explodes at the last moment of its
                lifetime. And, this particular explosion is known as
                "Supernova". This type of supernova explosion is actually the
                biggest explosion that occurs in the entire universe. A
                supernova can even outshine an entire galaxy. Before the
                explosion, a supernova can get about 100 billion kelvin hot.
                Till now, the "ASASSN-15lh" has been recorded as the brightest
                supernova ever. It reached a peak luminosity of about 570
                billion Solar Luminosity. That is twice as bright as any other
                supernovas discovered yet.

                According to astronomers, all the galaxies, stars, planets, etc.
                we have discovered as of yet just comprise about 4% of the
                entire universe. The rest of the 96% is made of unknown stuff.
                We haven't yet detected, seen, or even grasped the idea of the
                unknown universe. As a result, astronomers call them "Dark
                Energy" and "Dark Matter". Still, we know a lot. In fact, the
                observable universe is known to contain around 2 trillion
                galaxies and 1 billion trillions of stars. By contrast, there
                are more stars in the observable universe than there are grains
                of sand on our planet. Let that sink in for a moment!
